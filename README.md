# Blobfish App
## What is this App?
Blobfish is a 3D "Metaverse" world in which users can create their own avatars, create and join a virtual 3D world with other users and communicate through both audio as well as visually through their avatar facial movements - which are mapped and rendered realtime using the user's webcam.

This project was created and developed by [Jia En](https://github.com/Ennnm "Jia En") and [Justin Wong](https://github.com/JustinWong98 "Justin Wong"), as a project for their bootcamp.
