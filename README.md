# Blobfish App
## What is this App?
Blobfish is a 3D "Metaverse" world in which users can create their own avatars, create and join a virtual 3D world with other users and communicate through both audio as well as visually through their avatar facial movements - which are mapped and rendered realtime using the user's webcam.
